# LingkanUI

## Overview
LingkanUI provides various enhancements for World of Warcraft, including automatic sheath control, tab targeting fixes, and debug features.

## Tab Target Arena Fix

The Tab Target Arena Fix automatically adjusts tab targeting behavior in arenas to target enemy players only, avoiding accidentally targeting pets, totems, and other non-player entities.

### Features

- **Message control** - Choose whether to show chat messages when targeting mode changes

The Sheath Control feature allows you to automatically manage whether your weapons stay sheathed or unsheathed in World of Warcraft.

### Features
- **Toggle sheath control on/off** - Enable or disable the automatic sheath management
